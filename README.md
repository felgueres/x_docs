Terminology:
- price per billable action is not fixed, it's variable
- billable action: action that you pay for in your campaign

Bidding campaings
- Campaign objectives: 
  - followers: more people see ad
  - engagements: more likes, retweets, replies and clicks
  - website traffic: more visitors to website
  - keywords: users with high intent (beta!) - likely current work
- Bidding options: 
  - automatic - auto optimizer 
  - maximum bid - exactly how much to pay for a BA 
  - target bid - average daily cost
- Quality score:
  - ad is given quality score determined by resonance, relevancy and recency
  - strong copy and visuals are extremely important 
  - resonance: engagement
  - relevance: alignment with audience
  - recency: up-to-date content
- Other factors influencing pay per billable action:
  - Size of target audience
  - How many other advertisers are competing
- The combination of quality score and bid = ad score, this is metric that determines which ad will be served

How it works
- If you win the auction you get to make impressions
- When user does a billable action, you pay with a second price auction model
  You only pay whats needed for your ad to beat the 2nd place ad in the auction
  eg. if you bid $1.4 and beat an otherwise identical ad bidding $1.0, your campaign is charged 1.01 on the billable action
